        "Sawaya & Moroni",
        "Sawaya and Moroni"
      ],
      "reasoning": "To answer the question, one must first identify the entity associated with the creation of the original trophy as well as the one linked with the current trophy. The knowledge graph shows that the original trophy was 'crafted by' and 'manufactured by' the entity Sawaya & Moroni. Additionally, the current trophy is noted to be 'handcrafted by' the same entity. By correlating these relationships and noting the use of specific materials such as gold-plated sterling silver and design features like the spiral design—which are mentioned in relation to the trophies—the consistent role of Sawaya & Moroni in both iterations is revealed.",
