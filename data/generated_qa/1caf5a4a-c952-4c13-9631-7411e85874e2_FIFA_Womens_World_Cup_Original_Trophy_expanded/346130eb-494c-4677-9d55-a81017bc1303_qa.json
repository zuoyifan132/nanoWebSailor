      "question": "Both the FIFA Women's World Cup Original Trophy and the Current FIFA Women's World Cup Trophy were unveiled in 1998. Considering that these two trophies have distinct design features, which trophy is specifically known for having the names of winning teams engraved on it, and who was its designer?",
      "answer": [
        "FIFA Women's World Cup Original Trophy",
        "Original Trophy"
      ],
      "reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning: First, we note that both trophies share the same unveiling year (1998). Then, by examining the properties of each trophy, we observe that the Original Trophy is described as being engraved with the names of winning teams. Additionally, it is noted that it was designed by William Sawaya. The Current Trophy, while having features such as a marble base, does not have this engraving property. Thus, synthesizing these pieces of information leads to the conclusion that the trophy known for having the winning teams’ names engraved and designed by William Sawaya is the FIFA Women's World Cup Original Trophy.",
