      "reasoning": "The problem requires synthesizing multiple relationships: first, the original trophy is explicitly described as being designed by William Sawaya; second, the current trophy, which is the successor of the original, is also designed by William Sawaya. Although the firm Sawaya & Moroni is responsible for crafting and manufacturing both trophies, the design credit consistently goes to William Sawaya. By connecting these relationships, we conclude that William Sawaya is the entity common to both design attributions.",
