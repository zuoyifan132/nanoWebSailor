      "question": "The FIFA Women's World Cup trophies have undergone changes in their designs and materials over the years. Considering that the Original Trophy (introduced in 1999) was made of 'sterling silver and gold' and the current trophy is described in similar terms, by synthesizing the known properties of sterling silver (specifically that 92.5% pure silver is known as sterling silver and exhibits properties of ductility and is measured in karats), which material is explicitly used in the construction of the current FIFA Women’s World Cup Trophy?",
      "answer": [
        "gold-plated sterling silver",
        "gold plated sterling silver"
      ],
      "reasoning": "First, we note that the Original Trophy was made of 'sterling silver and gold' and has a successor, the current trophy. Then, through the properties provided, we see that 92.5% pure silver is defined as sterling silver, and this term is used as part of the material composition of the current trophy. Additionally, the current trophy is explicitly stated to be made of 'gold-plated sterling silver'. The relationship between the alloy’s properties (ductility and measurement by karats) and its composition confirms that the material used in the current trophy is indeed gold-plated sterling silver. Hence, synthesizing information across multiple nodes and relationships confirms the answer.",

          "Step 4: Synthesize the data to confirm that since 92.5% pure silver (sterling silver) is a defining component and it is cast/gilded, the current trophy’s material is confirmed as 'gold-plated sterling silver'."
