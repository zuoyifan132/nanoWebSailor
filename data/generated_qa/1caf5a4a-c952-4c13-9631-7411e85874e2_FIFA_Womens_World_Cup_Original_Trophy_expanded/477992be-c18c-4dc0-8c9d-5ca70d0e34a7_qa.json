      "question": "Considering the evolution of the FIFA Women's World Cup Trophy—from the original design introduced in 1999, which features a spiral design symbolizing growth and dynamism, to its current iteration that is also celebrated for embodying the global nature of the sport—which individual is recognized as the key designer responsible for both the original trophy and its successor, while also founding the firm that handcrafted these prestigious artifacts?",

        "William Sawaya",

      ],
      "reasoning": "The task requires synthesizing multiple pieces of information from the knowledge graph and supporting source texts. First, we note that both the original and the current FIFA Women's World Cup Trophies were designed by the same person, as indicated by multiple relationships (e.g., 'designed_by William Sawaya' for both trophies). In addition, the original trophy is described as a prestigious artifact and is linked to the label of 'designed by William Sawaya'. Furthermore, Sawaya & Moroni, the firm linked with the trophy craftsmanship, was founded by William Sawaya, which reinforces his pivotal role. The spiral design property—symbolizing growth, evolution, and transformation—is featured on the current trophy, and although it is part of its design aesthetics, the common thread in both trophy versions is the involvement of William Sawaya. Thus, reasoning across these entities and relationships leads to the conclusion that William Sawaya is the key individual whose contributions have defined both trophies.",
