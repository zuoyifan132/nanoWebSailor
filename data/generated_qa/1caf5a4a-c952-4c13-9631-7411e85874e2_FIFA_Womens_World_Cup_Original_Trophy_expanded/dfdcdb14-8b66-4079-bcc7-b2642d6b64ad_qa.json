        "Zaha Hadid",

      "reasoning": "First, we identify the multi-sport event as the 2010 Asian Games, which was held in China, and note that the Guangzhou Opera House, completed in the same period, is located in China. Next, we determine that the Guangzhou Opera House was designed by an architect. We then look for the architect with a connection to a historically significant city and find that Zaha Hadid was born in Baghdad, Iraq—a city that was sacked by the Mongols. By synthesizing these pieces of information—her birthplace, the historical event associated with that city, and her design of the Guangzhou Opera House completed during the 2010 Asian Games—we conclude that the architect in question is Zaha Hadid.",
