The allure of gold has led to numerous historical events, including the Gold Rushes of the 19th century, which played a crucial role in the economic development of regions like California and Australia. Sterling silver, while not as ancient as gold, has also been highly prized. It became prominent in the 12th century when it was adopted as the standard for English coinage. The term 'sterling' is believed to have originated from the 'Easterlings,' a group of merchants from the Baltic region who traded silver coins.
