The inaugural FIFA Women's World Cup was held in 1991 in China, but it wasn't until the 1999 tournament in the United States that the current trophy design was introduced. Prior to this, the trophy awarded was a simpler design, reflecting the nascent stage of the competition. The introduction of the new trophy design in 1999 coincided with a landmark tournament that significantly boosted the profile of women's football, particularly in the United States, where the final was played in front of a record-breaking crowd of over 90,000 spectators at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. This event marked a turning point, showcasing the potential and popularity of women's football. Since then, the trophy has been awarded to the champions of each subsequent Women's World Cup, serving as a symbol of excellence and a source of inspiration for aspiring female footballers around the world.\",\n            \"relevance_score\": 0.85\n        },\n        {\n            \"title\": \"The FIFA Women's World Cup Trophy and Its Role in Promoting Gender Equality in Sports\",\n            \"content\": \"The FIFA Women's World Cup Trophy is more than just a symbol of victory; it plays a significant role in promoting gender equality in sports.
