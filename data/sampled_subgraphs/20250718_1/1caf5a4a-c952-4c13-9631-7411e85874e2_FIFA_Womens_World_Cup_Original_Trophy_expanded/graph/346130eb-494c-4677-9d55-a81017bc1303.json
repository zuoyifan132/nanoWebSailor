Designed by William Sawaya and crafted by Milanese specialists Sawaya & Moroni, the trophy was unveiled in 1998. The design is a testament to elegance and modernity, featuring a spiral band that wraps around a football at the top. This spiral represents the athleticism, dynamism, and grace of the sport, while the ball symbolizes the global nature of football. The trophy stands 47 centimeters tall and weighs approximately 4.6 kilograms, crafted from sterling silver and 23-karat yellow and white gold. The base of the trophy is made of a semi-precious mineral called sodalite, which adds to its aesthetic appeal.
